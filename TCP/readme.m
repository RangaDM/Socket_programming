This program demonstrates basic socket programming between a server and a client. The server and client establish a connection, allowing the client to send a message to the server. The server then converts the message to capital letters and sends it back to the client. The client displays the converted message in its console. This program showcases the fundamental concepts of socket communication, including establishing connections, sending and receiving data, and processing data on the server side.
